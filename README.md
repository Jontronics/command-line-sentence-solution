# CLI Warmup
Using only the cd, ls and cp commands (don't use finder or mkdir), copy folders from the verbs, adverbs, nouns and conjunction folders into the sentence directory to create a directory heirarchy that forms a sentence.

# Example
`the/zebra/joyously/dreamt/while/the/lion/secretively/leapt`

# Tips
* Use tab completion to help you narrow down what folders to copy
